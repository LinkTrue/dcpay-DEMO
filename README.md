# DCPay

A **D**ecentralized **P**ayment **G**ateway that eliminates custodial risk and guarantees verifiable crypto settlements.

## Why
- Centralized processors can fail, freeze, or censor funds.
- Payment data is often opaque and unverifiable.
- Compliance and audits depend on manual reconciliation.

## How
Autonomous AI agents verify each payment on-chain from multiple differnet sources (RPC Providers) and record results immutably on decentralized storage.
This creates a transparent, resilient, and tamper-proof payment layer.

## Results
- Zero downtime from single-point failures
- Instant, audit-ready payment logs
- Integration in minutes through webhooks or APIs

## Who It’s For
- **Payment processors** – build resilient, censorship-proof infrastructure
- **E-commerce & SaaS** – accept crypto directly, no intermediaries
- **DeFi treasuries & DAOs** – automate verification and recordkeeping
- **Exchanges & custodians** – delegate transaction validation for continuous uptime
- **Fintech developers** – integrate trustless crypto payments easily
- **Auditors & compliance teams** – access verifiable records on IPFS and blockchain


## Key Benefits (Bullets)

- No single point of failure
- 24/7 autonomous uptime
- Auditable settlement data
- Plug-and-play integration
